# Discord Module

This module allows notifications to be registered on Discord, and messages sent to channels about WC3 games. To use this
module, you will need to create a Discord bot, and then add the bot to your server.

## Configuration

This module has only a single configuration property; `discord.privateToken`. This property is the client secret for
your Discord bot.

## Using the Discord bot

The Discord bot has 3 slash commands that can be used: `/notify`, `/stopnotify`, and `/help`. Please use these commands
to see the documentation for them.
